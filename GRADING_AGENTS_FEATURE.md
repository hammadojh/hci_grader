# Grading Agents Feature

## Overview
The grading agents feature allows instructors to add multiple AI-powered grading agents to assist with evaluating student answers. Each agent acts as a different instructor perspective and suggests levels for each rubric criteria.

## Key Features

### 2. **AI-Powered Suggestions**
- Each agent analyzes:
  - The question text
  - The current student's answer
  - All other student answers (for calibration)
  - All rubric criteria and levels
- Generates suggestions for which level to select for each criteria
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for consistent, objective evaluation

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Agent suggestions appear as **colored circles** next to level names
- Circle shows the agent's identifier (g1, g2, etc.) in the agent's color
- Multiple agents can suggest the same level (showing agreement)
- Agents suggesting different levels show disagreement
- Helps instructors see at a glance how agents agree or disagree

### 4. **User Control**
- Final grading decision always belongs to the instructor
- Instructors can accept, modify, or ignore agent suggestions
- Agents are managed through the "ü§ñ Agents" button in the header
- Easy add/remove functionality

## Technical Implementation

### New Models
- **GradingAgent**: Stores agent configuration (name, color, questionId)
- **AgentSuggestion**: Embedded in Answer model, tracks which level each agent suggests

### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/grading-agents` - Create a new agent
- `GET /api/grading-agents?questionId=X` - Get all agents for a question
- `DELETE /api/grading-agents?agentId=X` - Remove an agent
- `POST /api/agent-suggest` - Generate AI suggestions for an agent

### Database Schema Changes
- **Answer.criteriaEvaluations** now includes optional `agentSuggestions` array
- Each suggestion contains `agentId` and `suggestedLevelIndex`

### UI Components
- Agent manager panel (collapsible)
- Agent list with color-coded badges
- Generate and remove buttons per agent
- Colored circles integrated into level selection UI

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Multiple agents help ensure grading consistency across students
2. **Time-Saving**: AI suggestions speed up the grading process
3. **Perspective**: Different agents may catch different aspects of quality
4. **Transparency**: Visual indicators show agreement/disagreement clearly
5. **Control**: Instructor always makes the final decision

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Agent feedback/reasoning (why they chose a particular level)
- Configurable agent personas (strict vs. lenient)
- Agent confidence scores
- Bulk apply agent suggestions
- Export agent agreement statistics
