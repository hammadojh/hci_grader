# Batch Upload Feature - Multiple Submission Processing

## Overview

The Batch Upload feature allows instructors to upload multiple student submissions at once and have them processed asynchronously. The AI automatically extracts:
- Student name
- Student email/ID
- All answers mapped to assignment questions

This feature provides real-time progress tracking and allows users to explore completed submissions while others are still processing in the background.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple File Upload
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag multiple files directly into the upload zone
- **File Picker**: Select multiple files using the file browser
- **Supported Formats**:
  - PDF documents
  - Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) with OCR
  - Markdown files (.md, .markdown)
  - Text files

### 2. Automatic Metadata Extraction
For each file, the AI extracts:
- **Student Name**: Automatically identified from the document
- **Email/ID**: Student email or ID found in the document
- **Answers**: All answers are parsed and mapped to the correct questions

### 3. Real-Time Progress Tracking
- **Overall Progress**: Shows total completion percentage
- **Per-File Status**: Each file displays:
  - Current processing step
  - Progress percentage (0-100%)
  - Status icon (‚è≥ pending, üîÑ processing, ‚úÖ completed, ‚ùå error)
  - Extracted student information once available

### 4. Processing Steps (Per File)
Each file goes through these stages with clear feedback:
1. **Extracting text** (10-30%): OCR/text extraction from file
2. **Extracting metadata** (30-50%): AI identifies student name and email
3. **Parsing answers** (50-80%): AI maps answers to questions
4. **Creating submission** (80-100%): Saves to database

### 5. Async Processing
- Files are processed in parallel in the background
- Users can explore completed submissions immediately
- Status updates every 2 seconds via polling
- Can close modal and processing continues

## Technical Details

### Architecture

#### Models

**BatchUpload Model** (`models/BatchUpload.ts`)
```typescript
{
  assignmentId: string;
  totalFiles: number;
  completedFiles: number;
  failedFiles: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'partial' | 'failed';
  files: [
    {
      fileName: string;
      fileSize: number;
      status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'error';
      currentStep: 'extracting_text' | 'extracting_metadata' | 'parsing_answers' | 'creating_submission';
      progress: number; // 0-100
      submissionId?: string;
      studentName?: string;
      studentEmail?: string;
      error?: string;
      startedAt?: Date;
      completedAt?: Date;
    }
  ];
}
```

**Updated Submission Model**
- Added `processingStatus` field
- Added `extractedText` field (stores original text)
- Added `batchUploadId` field (reference to batch)

#### API Endpoints

**POST `/api/batch-upload`**
- Initializes a new batch upload
- Creates BatchUpload record with pending files
- Returns batchId for tracking

**POST `/api/batch-upload/process-file`**
- Processes a single file from the batch
- Steps:
  1. Extract text (OCR for images/PDFs)
  2. Extract student metadata (name, email)
  3. Parse answers using AI
  4. Create submission and answers in database
- Updates BatchUpload status in real-time

**GET `/api/batch-upload?batchId={id}`**
- Returns current status of a batch upload
- Used for polling progress updates

#### Frontend Flow

1. **File Selection**: User selects multiple files via drag-drop or file picker
2. **Initialization**: POST to `/api/batch-upload` creates batch record
3. **Async Processing**: Each file sent to `/api/batch-upload/process-file` in parallel
4. **Status Polling**: GET `/api/batch-upload?batchId={id}` every 2 seconds
5. **UI Updates**: Progress bars and status icons update in real-time
6. **Completion**: User can view/grade submissions or close modal

### AI Processing

#### 1. Text Extraction
- **PDFs**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to extract text
- **Images**: Uses GPT-4o Vision API for OCR
- **Text/Markdown**: Direct text reading

#### 2. Metadata Extraction
Uses GPT-4o with specialized prompt:
```
Extract student name and email from this document.
If not found, use defaults:
- name: "Unknown Student"
- email: "no-email@unknown.com"
```

#### 3. Answer Parsing
Same intelligent parsing as single-file upload:
- Maps answers to questions using semantic matching
- Handles various answer formats
- Provides confidence scores

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results

1. **File Naming**: Include student names in filenames when possible (e.g., "john_doe_assignment.pdf")
2. **Document Structure**: Encourage students to include their name and email at the top
3. **Question Numbers**: Students should label answers with question numbers
4. **File Quality**: Use clear, high-resolution images for handwritten submissions
5. **Batch Size**: Upload 5-20 files at a time for best performance

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Email Not Found**
- AI will use default: "no-email@unknown.com"
- You can edit the submission after processing

**Scenario 2: Name Not Found**
- AI will use default: "Unknown Student"
- You can edit the submission after processing

**Scenario 3: Processing Takes Long**
- Each file takes 30-90 seconds depending on:
  - File size
  - File type (images take longer due to OCR)
  - Number of questions
- Processing is async - you can explore completed files while others process

**Scenario 4: Processing Error**
- File shows error status with reason
- Completed files are still saved
- You can re-upload failed files individually

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Settings
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Ensure key has access to GPT-4o model

### Issue: Files Not Processing
**Check:**
- File format is supported
- Files aren't corrupted
- Internet connection is stable
- OpenAI API has sufficient credits

### Issue: Incorrect Name/Email Extracted
**Solution:**
1. After processing completes, click "View" on the submission
2. Edit the student name and email
3. Save changes

### Issue: Answers Mapped to Wrong Questions
**Solution:**
1. View the submission
2. Manually correct the answers
3. Consider asking students to use clear question numbers

### Issue: Processing Stuck
**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes (some files take time)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Refresh page and check submissions list (may have completed)
4. Re-upload if necessary

## Comparison: Single vs Batch Upload

| Feature | Single Upload | Batch Upload |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Files at once | 1 | Unlimited |
| Manual name/email entry | Yes | No (AI extracts) |
| Processing | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| Progress tracking | Basic | Detailed per-file |
| Can explore while processing | No | Yes |
| Best for | Individual submissions | Multiple submissions |
| Time per file | 30-90 seconds | 30-90 seconds (parallel) |

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time
- **Small text files**: ~20-30 seconds per file
- **PDFs**: ~40-60 seconds per file
- **Images with OCR**: ~60-90 seconds per file

### Parallel Processing
- All files are processed in parallel
- Limited only by OpenAI API rate limits
- Typical rate limit: 60 requests per minute (GPT-4o)

### Resource Usage
- Minimal browser memory (polling is lightweight)
- Server-side processing (no client-side load)
- Database updates are batched efficiently

## Privacy & Security

- All processing uses your OpenAI API key
- Student data is stored in your MongoDB database
- No data shared with third parties
- Extracted text is truncated to 10,000 characters in database
- Follow your institution's data privacy policies

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email notifications when batch completes
- Export batch processing report
- Retry failed files automatically
- Support for .docx files
- Custom metadata extraction rules
- Bulk editing of extracted metadata
- Processing history and analytics
