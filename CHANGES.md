# Changes Made - Version 2.0

## Summary of Updates

All requested fixes have been implemented successfully. The application now features an improved rubric system with multi-level criteria, percentage-based grading, dark text inputs, and an explicit save button in the grading interface.

---

## 1. ✅ Dark Text Input Colors

**What Changed:**
- All text inputs, textareas, and select elements now have dark text (#111827)
- Placeholder text is a medium gray (#6b7280) for better contrast

**Files Modified:**
- `app/globals.css` - Added CSS rules in @layer base for consistent dark text across all inputs

**Result:**
Text in all form inputs is now clearly visible and easy to read.

---

## 2. ✅ Save Button Added to Grading Interface

**What Changed:**
- Added explicit "Save All Grades" button at the top and bottom of the grading page
- Shows "Saving..." state while processing
- Displays success/error messages after save attempt
- Changes are now saved only when the button is clicked (no auto-save)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/grade/[submissionId]/page.tsx` - Added save functionality with local state management

**Features:**
- Local state editing before saving
- Visual feedback during save
- Success confirmation message
- Error handling

---

## 3. ✅ Restructured Rubric System

**Old Structure:**
```
Rubric {
  criteria: "Excellent"
  points: 100
  description: "Complete and accurate"
}
```

**New Structure:**
```
Rubric {
  criteriaName: "Accuracy"
  levels: [
    {
      name: "Excellent"
      description: "Complete and accurate"
      percentage: 100
    },
    {
      name: "Good"
      description: "Mostly accurate"
      percentage: 75
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**What Changed:**
- Each rubric now represents a **criteria** (e.g., "Accuracy", "Completeness", "Clarity")
- Each criteria has **multiple levels** (minimum 1, no maximum)
- Each level has:
  - **Name**: Short identifier (e.g., "Excellent", "Good", "Fair")
  - **Description**: Detailed explanation
  - **Percentage**: Score (0-100%)

**Files Modified:**
- `models/Rubric.ts` - Complete restructure with nested levels
- `models/Answer.ts` - Added `selectedLevelIndex` to track which level was selected
- `app/assignment/[id]/page.tsx` - New rubric creation UI with dynamic level management
- `app/grade/[submissionId]/page.tsx` - New rubric selection showing all levels per criteria

**Benefits:**
- More flexible grading structure
- Multiple criteria can be evaluated per question
- Each criteria can have multiple performance levels
- Better alignment with standard rubric practices

## 4. ✅ Question Points as Percentages

**Old System:**
- Questions had absolute point values (e.g., 100 points)
- Total was sum of all question points

**New System:**
- Assignments have a **total points** value (e.g., 100)
- Questions have a **percentage** of total (e.g., 40%)
- Points are calculated: `(percentage / 100) × total assignment points`

**What Changed:**
- `Assignment` model: Added `totalPoints` field (default: 100)
- `Question` model: Changed `maxPoints` to `pointsPercentage` (0-100%)
- `Answer` model: Changed `pointsAwarded` to `pointsPercentage` (0-100%)

**Files Modified:**
- `models/Assignment.ts` - Added totalPoints
- `models/Question.ts` - Changed to pointsPercentage
- `models/Answer.ts` - Changed to pointsPercentage
- `app/page.tsx` - Added total points input to assignment creation
- `app/assignment/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to use percentages, shows warning if total ≠ 100%
- `app/grade/[submissionId]/page.tsx` - Calculates actual points from percentages

**Example:**
```
Assignment: Total Points = 200
Question 1: 40% = 80 points
Question 2: 30% = 60 points
Question 3: 30% = 60 points
Total: 100% = 200 points
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to adjust assignment total without recalculating all questions
- Clear percentage distribution
- Warning when percentages don't add to 100%
- More flexible grading system

4. Adjust points (auto-saves)

### New Workflow:
1. View answer
2. Select criteria and level from organized rubric display
3. Optionally override with custom percentage
4. Add feedback
5. Review all questions
6. **Click "Save All Grades" button**

## Data Migration Notes

If you have existing data from the old version, you'll need to update:

1. **Assignments:** Add `totalPoints: 100` (or your preferred default)
2. **Questions:** Rename `maxPoints` → `pointsPercentage`, calculate percentages
3. **Rubrics:** Convert to new structure:
   - Old `criteria` → new level `name`
   - Old `points` → new level `percentage`
   - Old `description` → new level `description`
   - Wrap in new structure with `criteriaName` and `levels` array
4. **Answers:** Rename `pointsAwarded` → `pointsPercentage`, calculate percentages

**Recommendation:** Start fresh with new assignments for best experience.

## Technical Details

### Models Schema

**Assignment:**
```typescript
{
  title: string
  description: string
  totalPoints: number (default: 100)
}
```

**Question:**
```typescript
{
  assignmentId: string
  questionText: string
  questionNumber: number
  pointsPercentage: number (0-100)
}
```

**Rubric:**
```typescript
{
  questionId: string
  criteriaName: string
  levels: [
    {
      name: string
      description: string
      percentage: number (0-100)
    }
  ] (min 1 level required)
}
```

**Answer:**
```typescript
{
  submissionId: string
  questionId: string
  answerText: string
  selectedRubricId?: string
  selectedLevelIndex?: number
  feedback?: string
  pointsPercentage?: number (0-100)
}
```

### Calculation Logic

**Question Points:**
```javascript
questionPoints = (question.pointsPercentage / 100) * assignment.totalPoints
```

**Answer Points:**
```javascript
// Percentage of question's worth
earnedPercentage = (answer.pointsPercentage / 100) * question.pointsPercentage

// Actual points
earnedPoints = (earnedPercentage / 100) * assignment.totalPoints
```

**Total Score:**
```javascript
totalPercentage = sum of all earnedPercentages
totalPoints = (totalPercentage / 100) * assignment.totalPoints
```

   - Verify display on home page

2. **Add Questions:**
   - Add multiple questions
   - Verify percentages sum to 100%
   - Test warning message when ≠ 100%
   - Check point calculations

3. **Create Rubrics:**
   - Test single-level rubrics
   - Test multi-level rubrics (3-5 levels)
   - Test add/remove level functionality
   - Verify percentage ranges (0-100)

4. **Add Submissions:**
   - Create test submission with answers
   - Verify all questions included

5. **Grade Submission:**
   - Select rubric levels (test each criteria)
   - Try custom percentage override
   - Add feedback to each question
   - Verify calculations
   - Test save button
   - Check success message

6. **Export CSV:**
   - Verify all columns present
   - Check percentage calculations
   - Verify point calculations
   - Test with Excel/Google Sheets

## Known Limitations

1. **No Undo:** Once saved, changes cannot be undone (except by re-grading)
2. **No Draft Autosave:** If you navigate away before saving, changes are lost
3. **No Rubric Editing:** Once created, rubrics cannot be edited (only add new ones)
4. **No Question Reordering:** Questions are numbered in creation order
5. **No Bulk Operations:** Each submission must be graded individually

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add rubric edit/delete functionality
- Add auto-save draft feature
- Add question reordering
- Add rubric templates
- Add batch grading
- Add grade statistics dashboard
- Add student view of feedback
- Add export to other formats (PDF, JSON)
